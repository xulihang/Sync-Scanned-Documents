# Sync Scanned Documents

Scan documents with [Dynamic Web TWAIN](https://www.dynamsoft.com/web-twain/overview/) and save them to a file synchronization service like Onedrive and Dropbox.

You can try it here: <https://blog.xulihang.me/Sync-Scanned-Documents/>.

Additional steps to run it on your own:

1. Replace the product key with yours. You can apply for a free trial license key [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense/?product=dwt).
2. Replace the client ids and redirect URIs with yours.
